**Predict the output of the below code. When you run the code, do you see what you expected? Why or why not?**

```
let array1 = [2, 6, 4];
let array2 = [2, 6, 4];

console.log(array1 === array2);
```

This should output as false. While the values are the same, the arrays themselves are not pointing to the same array.
