**How many arguments does the Array.prototype.join() method expect? What happens if you call it with less or more arguments?**

The `Array.prototype.join()` method's argument is optional. If you omit it, it will return a string with commas between each array element. Using more than one argument returns a string with all the elements joined with no spaces. It does not work.
